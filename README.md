# CrazyFrog NoteBlock Song
#### Macro KeyBind script, for Minecraft 1.12.2, that plays the CrazyFrog song theme, in a loop, using noteblocks.

The only script needed is the `crazyfrog_main.txt`. Run it on Minecraft 1.12.2 and follow the instructions. If you want change the name of this file, you'll need to change the first string variable in this script (it's in the first line of it, quite easy to find where).


The `crazyfrog_build_saver.txt` file shows what I needed to do to save the whole build, in an array, with the data I needed. Auxilarry to this script is a little onChat script (`crazyfrog_build_saver_onChat`), needed to get the information on NoteBlocks (to save the custom note of each one), and a file to send messages in the chat through exec (`echo.txt`), so I don't need to bother with the unsafe block. For this script to work the user need to have [klacaiba](https://spthiel.github.io/Modules/?name=Klacaiba) module installed.
